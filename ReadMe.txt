COOL THINGS YOU CAN FIND
It is pretty responsive. I am using 6 different @media. One is specifically made for phones (and, at least in mine, it shows you one layout when it is in portrait mode and then another one in landscape).

I use both flex (for the whole content) and grid (in the pictures). It let me discovered how powerful grid is!

The page "Cool Vocabulary" is not really full of all the words that I would like it to have, but it has a video that I love.

I made the Mexican playlist called "MÃ©xico in a Nutshell" and I believe it is worth hearing. Note: as it is an embedded Spotify playlist, sometimes the browser marks an error, but it works nonetheless (and it is not marked as error in the html validator).

The "blog entrance" that I finished (Anecdote0) is the real story of why I am here, feel free to read it! And, even though I "Loren Impsued" the other ones, all the pictures that appear are different, and they would be the ones I use in case I really want to write the blog-post.

If you click "send" in the contact form, it guides you to a "thank you" page. It doesn't do anything, and I will never be contacted, but it greets you!


NOTES
The fonts that I downloaded and added sometimes don't work, and I have no idea why. Sometimes Firefox decides to change it, while it works in Chrome, and sometimes viceversa. I have tried to figure out the circumstances that lead to those events, but I have not been able to crack it.

Images can take a bit to load. I know that it is good to make a website efficient by lowering the quality, nevertheless, they are really pretty, so I decided to leave them. They all load eventually and, frankly, they are beautiful (I took all of them).

For some reason, on the phone, the css is not loaded until one clicks one of the links on the Navigation Menu. I have no idea why, but that happens, so please click on something!
