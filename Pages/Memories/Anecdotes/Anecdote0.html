      <h2 class = "main-content-title">I am Home</h2>
      <div class="grid-container">
        <div class="text1">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">Hello, world! Thanks for being here! If it is your first time, let me introduce myself: I am Ana Bonavides Aguilar, but people call me Annie. I am a 19 years old Mexican living in Austria. Without further due, lets jump into this story!
          
          <br>
          <br>
          The first question that I always get asked, after people know I am a Mexican living is Austria, is: Why? Why would you leave your home? Why did you decide to study in <q>St. Pölten</q> (which they always emphasize). And, I get why they ask...México is pretty far away. Nevertheless, I never left home, instead, I arrived here.
        </div>
        
        <div class="text2">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">
            Everything began in Summer of 2019. Thanks to my Multicultural High School, I had to spend at least one month abroad, in one of the available countries. There were many options and, because I was full of projects during that period, I didn't spend that much time looking into them. Hence, I asked my best friend where he was going, and decided to take the same trip: an Engineering Summer Course in Austria. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            It sounded cool, they spoke german over there (which was the third language I was taking) and it was in Europe, a place I had always wanted to know.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text3">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">I hadn't really put that much thought into the trip. But I began getting more and more excited every day. Simple facts began thrilling me, like knowing RedBull was Austrian, and that Vienna had been considered the best city to live in the world for quite some years now.
          <br>
          <br>
          I looked into Austrian history, and it turns out that it was connected to Mexican one! I even discovered a song called "Vienna" by Billy Joel that described how I felt perfectly and was based on the city I was about to visit. Little by little this unknown land was thrilling more and more.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text4">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">But little did I know that after being there only three weeks, I would completely fall in love with the place. One day I was near <q>Karlsplatz</q>, wandering around, when I turned around and saw the landscape shown on the left picture. 
          <br>
          <br>
          That view imprinted on my eyes, heart and soul, as it was the exact moment when I realized that I wanted to move there. I took my phone out, and immortalized the beginning of the rest of my life.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text5">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">It was this movie-perfect moment, hearing Vienna (Ben Plat's version), while feeling the cold air and warm sunshine hitting my face. It was feeling calm and happy, in a country where the government protects their people, and opportunities are available for everyone.
          <br>
          <br>
          I know realized that I constructed this perfect utopia in my mind, which is not necessarily true. But, even with its flaws, Austria has become my home. And I knew that would happen since 2019, when Wien called my name. It turns out, it was indeed waiting for me.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text6">
          <p class = "anecdote-text">
          The second part of the adventure started on September 4, 2021. Only three years, two summers and one pandemic after my previously-mentioned serendipity, I made it out of Latin America and found my way to St.Pölten. The excuse was studying, but the reality behind me being here, is changing my life.
          <br>
          <br>
          I left my friends, family, and language to come to an unknown land and discover it. I have fallen in love with the people, culture, landscapes, and have formed my own family. It has been no bed of roses, but it is all worth it. Because, at the end of the day, I am home.
