## What this is about
Hello, World! Welcome to my final project of the Introduction to Web Technologies course. In here you will find the .css and .html scripts that I used for by blog " 'Mexicanita' in Austria". All of the programming and assets used were made by me for this specific project. Nevertheless, the general design concept had already been created. It was the one used for my personal blog (which you can see [here](https://anniebonav.com "Annie Bonav's Blog")).
## Final result
You can see the finalized webpage [here](https://cc211010.students.fhstp.ac.at/iwt/index.html "Mexicanitas Blog").
#### Enjoy going through it!
